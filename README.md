Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning 🚀

This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models. The Random Forest Classifier (85.31% accuracy) was selected as the best model after testing multiple classifiers.

📌 Features

✔ Machine Learning Model: Predicts customer churn with 85.31% accuracy using Random Forest.
✔ SMOTE Oversampling: Handles class imbalance for better model performance.
✔ Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses GridSearchCV for optimization.
✔ Web App Deployment: Built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.
✔ User-Friendly Interface: Allows easy input of customer details and generates churn predictions instantly.

📊 Dataset & Model

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (public dataset)

Target Variable: Churn (0 = No Churn, 1 = Churn)

Models Tested: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest

Final Model: Optimized Random Forest (85.31% accuracy)
